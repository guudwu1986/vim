*01.3*	Using the Vim tutor				*tutor* *vimtutor*

This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without
the risk of damaging the original.
   There are a few translated versions of the tutor.  To find out if yours is
available, use the two-letter language code.  For French: >

	vimtutor fr

On Unix, if you prefer using the GUI version of Vim, use "gvimtutor" or
"vimtutor -g" instead of "vimtutor".

For OpenVMS, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start vimtutor from a
VMS prompt with: >

	@VIM:vimtutor

Optionally add the two-letter language code as above.


On other systems, you have to do a little work:

1. Copy the tutor file.  You can do this with Vim (it knows where to find it):
>
	vim -u NONE -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
<
   This will write the file "TUTORCOPY" in the current directory.  To use a
translated version of the tutor, append the two-letter language code to the
filename.  For French:
>
	vim -u NONE -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor.fr' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
<
2. Edit the copied file with Vim:
>
	vim -u NONE -c "set nocp" TUTORCOPY
<
   The extra arguments make sure Vim is started in a good mood.

3. Delete the copied file when you are finished with it:
>
	del TUTORCOPY
<
